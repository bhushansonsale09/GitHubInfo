This is My First GitHub Repository, From this Repository, I am going to Start My Journey as a Open Source Developer, and Contribute to Many Many Projects. 
1. Configuring Git

   git config --global user.email"someone@email.com"
   git config --list

2. Clone & Status
   Clone - Cloning a repository on our local machine
   git clone <- some link ->
